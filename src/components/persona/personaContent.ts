    Here are some overall measures influence of personalization on YouTube recommendations. We found that on average, when a persona watched the same video in the same week, only **26% of recommendations were repeated**. This is a baseline that we compare the personalization to.
    
    **Persona Personalization**
    When a persona watched the **same video as an anonymous user** within 7 days, only 16% of recommendations were repeated - **10% less repeated recommendations vs watching as the same persona**.

    When a personas watch **different videos** on the same day, only 6% of recommendations were repeated - **20% less repeated recommendations vs watching the same video**.
